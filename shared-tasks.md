## Shared Tasks


The NLP community has a great tradition of "shared tasks".  Many of these are perfect for a term-project for this class, since they give you a great starting point for a problem definition, training and test data, a standard evaluation metric, and lots of published baselines.  Here are some pointers to shared tasks that were featured at CoNLL, SemEval, WMT, and Kaggle. 

You are welcome to choose a shared task topic for your term project.

### CoNLL Shared Tasks

## Kaggle 

Kaggle is a platform for machine learning competitions where people compete to produce the best models for a huge range of different datasets. Companies often offer a reward for their competitions.  There's tons of cool data and competitions that you can base your final project on.  

Here are a few relevant competitions:
* [Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews)
* [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)
* [Convert English text from written expressions into spoken forms](https://www.kaggle.com/c/text-normalization-challenge-english-language)
* [Quora Question Pairs - Can you identify question pairs that have the same intent?](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs)
