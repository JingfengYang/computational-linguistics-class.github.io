Python resources
=============================================================

- Python itself has good documentation and a decent getting started page [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html).
- Python gives a list of good tutorials [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers). Many are focused on people with no programming background, but two that seem a bit less introductory are the [Python in 10 minutes](http://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/) tutorial, and [Google's Python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/).
- There is a [Coursera course on Python](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython) running now.
- [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is an amazingly easy library for doing machine learning in Python. It is also wonderfully verbosely documented with tons of examples.
- [Kaggle has some tutorials on sklearn](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-london-scikit-learn/visualization)
- [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) is a great library for doing natural language processing in Python.  It also has an accompanying book called [Intro to NLP in Python](http://www.nltk.org/book/). 
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io) is another excellent Python NLP library.  It also has a cleverly named visualization tool, [displaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/visualizers).

Bash resources
==============

- [John](https://seas.upenn.edu/~johnhew/) has a basic introduction to bash for NLP [here](tutorials/2017-03-06-bash-for-nlp-tutorial-basic.md), and a discussion of advanced topics in bash [here](tutorials/2017-03-07-bash-for-nlp-tutorial-topics.md).
- Kevin Knight of the University of Southern California has a nice unix skills for NLP tutorial [here](http://www.isi.edu/natural-language/mt/unix.txt).
